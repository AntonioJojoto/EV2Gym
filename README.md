# EVsSimulator
A realistic V2X Simulation Environment for large scale EV charging optimization!

<!-- Bullet points with all the benefits -->
## Features

* The simulator can be used to evaluate any type of algorithm to gain insights into its efficiency.
* The “gym environment” can readily support the development of RL algorithms.
* Uses only open-source data.
* Replays of simulations are saved and can be solved optimally using the Gurobi Solver.
* Easy to incorporate additional functionality for any use-case.
* Does not simulate the grid yet, but groups EV chargers at the level of the transformer/ parking lot, etc, so extra functionality can be easily added.
