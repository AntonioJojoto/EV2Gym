# EVsSimulator
A V2X Simulation Environment for large scale EV charging optimization

# Future Ideas
Here, I will write down abstract ideas about the V2X problem I am trying to solve:
- Use PandaPower to simulate the grid (use it with the power transformer class id characteristics)
- Support any kind of  MV or LV network for the PandaPower grid

# Assumptions
Assumptions regarding the EVsSimulator environment:
- Power that is charged and discharged is tranferred in the:
    1. charger level 
    2. parking lot/ building level
    3. transformer level
    4. grid level (PandaPower)
